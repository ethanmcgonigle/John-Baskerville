      <div class="item2">Stefan Sagmeister is an American-based graphic designer and typographer. He was born in Bregenz, Austria on the 6th of August 1962. Over the years Sagmeister has recieved grammy awards for the best recording package and the best special limited edition packages. He has designed album covers for artists such as The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith and Jay-Z. Sagmeister also received an AIGA medal in 2013 (the highest award of the design profession). He founded his own website with designer Jessica Walsh who originates from New York. One of Sagmeister's more recent pieces of work and perhaps considered to be more successful would be 'The Happy Film'. In this, Sagmeister takes on the daunting project of changing his personality by trying to figure out the causes of happiness. On the advice of a trusted psychologist, Stefan experiments with three different approaches: meditation, therapy, and drugs. </div>
