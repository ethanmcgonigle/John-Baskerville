      <div class="item2">Stefan Sagmeister is famously known as a graphic designer and typographer who co-founded the firm Sagmeister & Walsh with Jessica Walsh. He was born in Austria and is now based in New York where a lot of his present work is produced from his studio. As one of the most recognisable designers in the world; there is no doubt his work has distinguishable characteristics that separates it from other designers. So addressing my question, I plan on bringing these characteristics or features to light throughout. I will firstly focus on Sagmeister’s inclination to typography. Using my in depth knowledge, it will be my focus to analyse the forms/maxims he creates and give my interpretation on how they have resulted in such success. Using sources such as Sagmeister’s books, I will also select a variety of projects he has committed himself too and deem them to be either as spontaneous as they seem at first glance, or whether there could be more to them than meets the eye. My essay will show a clear understanding of each piece of work selected, aided by a concise argument to support my view.</div>
