                <p>Reference to intern carving AIGA poster into his skin. <b>“For this lecture poster for AIGA Detroit we tried to visualise the pain that seems to accompany most of our design projects.

Found on <i>www.creativepro.com</i>i> just below the photograph of the carvings and posted on: 20/1/16.
